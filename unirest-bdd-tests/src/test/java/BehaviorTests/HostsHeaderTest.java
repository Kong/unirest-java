     * # The 'jdk.httpclient.allowRestrictedHeaders' property allows one or more of these

     * # to be used in real deployments. Protocol errors or other undefined behavior is likely
     * # to occur when using them. The property is not set by default.
     * # Note also, that there may be other headers that are restricted from being set
     * # depending on the context. This includes the "Authorization" header when the
     * # relevant HttpClient has an authenticator set. These restrictions cannot be
     * # overridden by this property.
