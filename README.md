# Unirest for Java [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Mashape/unirest-java.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Mashape/unirest-java)

Do yourself a favor, and start making HTTP requests like this:

```java
Unirest.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
  .queryString("name", "Mark")
  .field("last", "Polo")
  .asJson()
```

Unirest is a set of lightweight HTTP libraries available in multiple languages, ideal for most applications:

* Make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` requests
* Both syncronous and asynchronous (non-blocking) requests
* It supports form parameters, file uploads and custom body entities
* Easily add route parameters without ugly string concatenations
* Supports gzip
* Supports Basic Authentication natively
* Customizable timeout and concurrency levels
* Customizable default headers for every request (DRY)
* Customizable `HttpClient` and `HttpAsyncClient` implementation
* Automatic JSON parsing into a native object for JSON responses

## Installing
Is easy as pie. Kidding. It's about as easy as doing these little steps:

### With Maven

You can use Maven by including the library:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mashape.unirest</groupId>
    <artifactId>unirest-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.27</version>
</dependency>
```

There are dependencies for Unirest-Java, these should be already installed, and they are as follows:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
  <version>4.3.6</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpasyncclient</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.2</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpmime</artifactId>
  <version>4.3.6</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.json</groupId>
  <artifactId>json</artifactId>
  <version>20140107</version>
</dependency>
```

If you would like to run tests, also add the following dependency along with the others:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.11</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Without Maven

Alternatively if you don't use Maven, you can directly include the JAR file in the classpath: http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/mashape/unirest/unirest-java/1.3.27/unirest-java-1.3.27.jar

Don't forget to also install the dependencies ([`org.json`](http://www.json.org/java/), [`httpclient 4.3.6`](http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi), [`httpmime 4.3.6`](http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi), [`httpasyncclient 4.0.2`](http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi)) in the classpath too.

There is also a way to generate a Unirest-Java JAR file that already includes the required dependencies, but you will need Maven to generate it. Follow the instructions at http://blog.mashape.com/post/69117323931/installing-unirest-java-with-the-maven-assembly-plugin

## Creating Request
So you're probably wondering how using Unirest makes creating requests in Java easier, here is a basic POST request that will explain everything:

```java
HttpResponse<JsonNode> jsonResponse = Unirest.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
  .header("accept", "application/json")
  .queryString("apiKey", "123")
  .field("parameter", "value")
  .field("foo", "bar")
  .asJson();
```

Requests are made when `as[Type]()` is invoked, possible types include `Json`, `Binary`, `String`. If the request supports and it is of type `HttpRequestWithBody`, a body it can be passed along with `.body(String|JsonNode)`. If you already have a map of parameters or do not wish to use seperate field methods for each one there is a `.fields(Map<String, Object> fields)` method that will serialize each key - value to form parameters on your request.

`.headers(Map<String, String> headers)` is also supported in replacement of multiple header methods.

### Route Parameters

Sometimes you want to add dynamic parameters in the URL, you can easily do that by adding a placeholder in the URL, and then by setting the route parameters with the `routeParam` function, like:

```java
Unirest.get("http://httpbin.org/{method}")
  .routeParam("method", "get")
  .queryString("name", "Mark")
  .asJson();
```
In the example above the final URL will be `http://httpbin.org/get` - Basically the placeholder `{method}` will be replaced with `get`.

The placeholder's format is as easy as: `{custom_name}`

## Asynchronous Requests
Sometimes, well most of the time, you want your application to be asynchronous and not block, Unirest supports this in Java using anonymous callbacks, or direct method placement:

```java
Future<HttpResponse<JsonNode>> future = Unirest.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
  .header("accept", "application/json")
  .field("param1", "value1")
  .field("param2", "value2")
  .asJsonAsync(new Callback<JsonNode>() {

	public void failed(UnirestException e) {
		System.out.println("The request has failed");
	}

	public void completed(HttpResponse<JsonNode> response) {
		 int code = response.getStatus();
	     Map<String, String> headers = response.getHeaders();
	     JsonNode body = response.getBody();
	     InputStream rawBody = response.getRawBody();
	}

	public void cancelled() {
		System.out.println("The request has been cancelled");
	}

});
```

## File Uploads
Creating `multipart` requests with Java is trivial, simply pass along a `File` Object as a field:

```java
HttpResponse<JsonNode> jsonResponse = Unirest.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
  .header("accept", "application/json")
  .field("parameter", "value")
  .field("file", new File("/tmp/file"))
  .asJson();
```

## Custom Entity Body

```java
HttpResponse<JsonNode> jsonResponse = Unirest.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
  .header("accept", "application/json")
  .body("{\"parameter\":\"value\", \"foo\":\"bar\"}")
  .asJson();
```

## Basic Authentication
Authenticating the request with basic authentication can be done by calling the `basicAuth(username, password)` function:
```java
HttpResponse<JsonNode> response = Unirest.get("http://httpbin.org/headers").basicAuth("username", "password").asJson();
```

# Request

The Java Unirest library follows the builder style conventions. You start building your request by creating a `HttpRequest` object using one of the following:

```java
GetRequest request = Unirest.get(String url);
GetRequest request = Unirest.head(String url);
HttpRequestWithBody request = Unirest.post(String url);
HttpRequestWithBody request = Unirest.put(String url);
HttpRequestWithBody request = Unirest.patch(String url);
HttpRequestWithBody request = Unirest.options(String url);
HttpRequestWithBody request = Unirest.delete(String url);
```

# Response

Upon recieving a response Unirest returns the result in the form of an Object, this object should always have the same keys for each language regarding to the response details.

- `.getStatus()` - HTTP Response Status Code (Example: 200)
- `.getStatusTest()` - HTTP Response Status Text (Example: "OK")
- `.getHeaders()` - HTTP Response Headers
- `.getBody()` - Parsed response body where applicable, for example JSON responses are parsed to Objects / Associative Arrays.
- `.getRawBody()` - Un-parsed response body

# Advanced Configuration

You can set some advanced configuration to tune Unirest-Java:

### Custom HTTP clients

You can explicitly set your own `HttpClient` and `HttpAsyncClient` implementations by using the following methods:

```java
Unirest.setHttpClient(httpClient);
Unirest.setAsyncHttpClient(asyncHttpClient);
```
### Timeouts

You can set custom connection and socket timeout values (in **milliseconds**):

```java
Unirest.setTimeouts(long connectionTimeout, long socketTimeout);
```

By default the connection timeout (the time it takes to connect to a server) is `10000`, and the socket timeout (the time it takes to receive data) is `60000`. You can set any of these timeouts to zero to disable the timeout.

### Default Request Headers

You can set default headers that will be sent on every request:

```java
Unirest.setDefaultHeader("Header1", "Value1");
Unirest.setDefaultHeader("Header2", "Value2");
```

You can clear the default headers anytime with:

```java
Unirest.clearDefaultHeaders();
```

### Concurrency

You can set custom concurrency levels if you need to tune the performance of the syncronous or asyncronous client:

```java
Unirest.setConcurrency(int maxTotal, int maxPerRoute);
```

By default the maxTotal (overall connection limit in the pool) is `200`, and the maxPerRoute (connection limit per target host) is `20`.

# Exiting an application

Unirest starts a background event loop and your Java application won't be able to exit until you manually shutdown all the threads by invoking:

```java
Unirest.shutdown();
```
